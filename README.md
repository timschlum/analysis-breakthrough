## Project 1 - R
I worked through a pair of datasets sourced from kaggle.com to analyze wearable fitness tracker data in R. This project can be found directly on kaggle.com at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/timotheeschlumberger/bellabeat-case-study-in-r).

This project is titled "Bellabeat Project in R" and is case study 2 in the Google Data Analystics Professional certificate capstone.

## Project 3 - Dataset building, cleaning and visualization with Tableau
This project is in two parts and consists of (1) a dataset I collated and cleaned which is available in my [Kaggle portfolio](https://www.kaggle.com/code/timotheeschlumberger/veganomicon) and (2) the resulting visualizations I built in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/timothee.schlumberger#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0). In this project I built a dataset from scratch from a complex recipe book in order to see if I could answer questions about vegan cooking I had after trying some of its recipes. I work through the process of collecting data in Exel format, cleaning the data to create consistent and useful data, and then visualize the data using the product of my work. I also build a dashboard to explore how I can present my findings as well as to see the outcomes of updating my work in real-time.

## Project 4 - Randomized Starship Dataset
Built a randomized maintenance ticket system for a fictional starship in the year 2102, the UNSE Pulsar. Created 100 fictional crew members being serviced by a small team of maintenance techs and created 1000 tickets covering the service year 2102. All data points were generated using 'randbetween' functions in Excel. Visualized the resulting data using Tableau public to show the state of the Pulsar during that year [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/timothee.schlumberger/vizzes).
