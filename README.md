## Project 1 - R
I worked through a pair of datasets sourced from kaggle.com to analyze wearable fitness tracker data in R. This project can be found directly on kaggle.com at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/timotheeschlumberger/bellabeat-case-study-in-r).

This project is titled "Bellabeat Project in R" and is case study 2 in the Google Data Analystics Professional certificate capstone.

## Project 3 - Dataset building, cleaning and Visualization with Tableau
This project is in two parts and consists of (1) a dataset I collated and cleaned which is available in my [Kaggle portfolio](https://www.kaggle.com/code/timotheeschlumberger/veganomicon) and (2) the resulting visualizations I built in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/timothee.schlumberger#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0). In this project I built a dataset from scratch from a complex recipe book in order to see if I could answer questions about vegan cooking I had after trying some of its recipes. I work through the process of collecting data in Exel format, cleaning the data to create consistent and clean data, and then visualize the data using the product of my work. I also build a dashboard to explore how I can present my findings as well as to see the outcomes of updating my work in real-time.
